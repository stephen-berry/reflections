How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It allowed me to compare the working version with the one that didn't work, only showing me the differences to speed up the process.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It shows you how you organized info before (maybe you know more and now want to optimize) and it shows you what worked before on it.
